					<h1>Me</h1>
					<p>I am a 21 year old design student. I was a volunteer at the local Chiro for four years. Were I was responsible for the entertainment of children. During these years I developed my leadership skills, my ability to make plannings and work on strict deadlines. By communicating with children, parent and other volunteers I refined my communication skills and become a better teamplayer.</p>

					<p>My friends would describe me as a calm person with her heart on the right place. I can be very presistent but I am also a real team player. I have the worst sense of humor, the lamer the joke the harder I will laugh, especially really bad puns. You can bribe me with amazing food or cute cats. </p>

					<h1>Experience</h1>
						<p>One of the requirement of the studies was an internship abroad. During internship, in the city of London, I gained working experience in the marketing sector. My job responisbilities included : assisting in the execution of the global marketing strategy, internal research on competitors, sales funnel and marketing campaigns and managing the social media accounts.</p>

						 	<p>By living on my own in Lonon I aslo learned to be responsible and independant. During this internship I discovered my passion for design and this was a turning point for me, and made me decide to start design studies. In the future I hope to combine business and design.</p>
